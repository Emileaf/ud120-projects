""" 
    Starter code for exploring the Enron dataset (emails + finances);
    loads up the dataset (pickled dict of dicts).

    The dataset has the form:
    enron_data["LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MIDDLEINITIAL"] = { features_dict }

    {features_dict} is a dictionary of features associated with that person.
    You should explore features_dict as part of the mini-project,
    but here's an example to get you started:

    enron_data["SKILLING JEFFREY K"]["bonus"] = 5600000
    
    enron_data["LASTNAME FIRSTNAME"]["feature_name"]
    enron_data["LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MIDDLEINITIAL"]["feature_name"]

What is the total value of the stock belonging to James Prentice?
Wesley Colwell to POI
Whatâ€™s the value of stock options exercised by Jeffrey K Skilling?
quantified salary
known email address
